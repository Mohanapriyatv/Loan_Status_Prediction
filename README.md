Project Overview:
          This project aims to predict the status of loan applications using various machine learning classification algorithms. 
          By leveraging data such as applicant demographics, credit history, and loan details, we can build models to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected.

Dataset:
          The dataset used in this project contains information about loan applications, including:

                  Applicant details (e.g., gender, marital status, education)
                  Applicant income and co-applicant income
                  Loan amount and loan term
                  Credit history
                  Property area
                  Loan status (target variable)
                  
          The dataset is available for download from Kaggle.

Installation:

    To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

        pandas
        numpy
        scikit-learn
        matplotlib
        seaborn
        You can install these dependencies using the following command:

Modeling:

    The project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: 

    Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 

    Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.

Model Training: 

    Training different classification models, including:
    
    Logistic Regression
    Decision Tree
    Random Forest
    XGBoost
    
Model Evaluation: 

    Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results:

    The results of the trained models, including performance metrics and visualizations, are documented in the Jupyter notebook. The best-performing model can be selected based on these evaluations.
